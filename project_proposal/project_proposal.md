# Project proposal
A project proposal for machine learning is a document that provides a detailed description of the proposed project, including its objectives, methods, resources, and expected outcomes. It is usually submitted to secure funding and resources for the project. 

Writing a proposal forces the team to clearly define the objectives, methods, and outcomes of the project, which can help to plan and organize the work more effectively.
It can also be used to communicate the details of the project to stakeholders, including team members, project sponsors, and other interested parties.

## 1. Problem statement
The problem statement of a machine learning project proposal is a clear and concise description of the problem that the project aims to solve. It should include the following elements:

1. The background and context of the problem: This includes the relevant industry, business or scientific area, and the current state of the field.

2. The specific problem: This should be a clear and concise statement of the problem that the project aims to solve.

3. The implications of the problem: This should explain why the problem is important and what the potential consequences are if the problem is not solved.

The problem statement is one of the most important parts of the proposal because it sets the context for the rest of the proposal and helps the reader understand the significance of the project. It should be written in a way that is easy to understand and should be brief, typically a few sentences.

It's essential that the problem statement is clear and well-defined, as it will guide the project in its development, testing, and evaluation. It should be based on facts, evidence, and be well-supported by research in the field.

### **Example**: 
*The problem that this project aims to solve is the lack of efficiency and effectiveness of current email marketing campaigns. Despite the widespread use of email marketing in the industry, many companies are facing challenges in terms of low open and click-through rates, resulting in low profitability. The goal of this project is to use machine learning models to improve the targeting and personalization of email campaigns in order to increase open and click-through rates and ultimately improve profitability. By implementing advanced machine learning techniques, this project will provide a solution to the industry-wide problem of underperforming email marketing campaigns and help companies boost their revenues.*

## 2. Key assumptions
The key assumptions section of a machine learning project proposal is a section that outlines the assumptions that are being made about the problem, data, and methods that the project is based on.
