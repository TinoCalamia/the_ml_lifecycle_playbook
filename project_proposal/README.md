# The ML project proposal

A project proposal document is an important tool for outlining the objectives, scope, and goals of a machine learning project, and for securing funding and resources for its implementation. A well-written proposal can help to communicate the value and potential impact of the project to key stakeholders, including business leaders and technical teams.

The proposal document should include an overview of the project, including its objectives, goals, and expected outcomes, as well as a detailed explanation of the machine learning methods that will be used. It should also include information about the data that will be used, including its quality, format, and availability, as well as any specific software or libraries that will be needed. Additionally, the proposal should include a detailed project plan, including timelines, milestones, and expected costs, and a clear explanation of how the project's success will be evaluated.

In addition to securing funding and resources, a project proposal document can also be used to align the project with the overall business strategy, and to ensure that it is aligned with the organizational goals and objectives. It can also help to ensure that all key stakeholders are aware of the project's objectives and goals, and that everyone is working towards the same objectives.

It's also important to review the proposal document regularly and update it as necessary, as the project progresses. This can help to ensure that the project stays on track and that it remains aligned with the business objectives and goals.

# How to use this proposal

The proposal in this repository should be used in any machine learning project. When setting up a new project in can be part of the docs folder.
It is important to maintain this document very well to always represent the current state, key assumptions and other important components of the project. Adding it to the GitHub repository allows other colleagues read through the document in the future and understand why certain decisions have been made for the model.
