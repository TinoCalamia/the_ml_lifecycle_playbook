# Dockerfiles for Containerization
This repository contains Dockerfiles that can be used to create containers for various applications. The containers are built using the Docker platform, which allows for easy deployment and management of software applications in containers.

## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have it already, you can download it from Docker's website (https://www.docker.com/).

Once you have Docker installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile you'd like to use.

## Building the Container
To build the container, you can use the following command:
```docker build -t [image_name] .```

Replace ```[image_name]``` with the name you'd like to give your image. The . at the end specifies the current directory as the build context.

## Running the Container
Once the build is complete, you can run the container using the following command:
```docker run [image_name]```

Replace ```[image_name]``` with the name of the image you built.
