# Experiment design

## The template
An experiment template is a standardized format for conducting and documenting experiments within a company. It helps to ensure that experiments are conducted in a consistent and organized manner, which can improve the reliability and reproducibility of results.

Having a template for experiments can be helpful for a company in several ways:

* It ensures that all important information is captured and recorded in a consistent format, making it easier to compare and analyze results across different experiments.
* It helps to standardize the process of conducting experiments, reducing the likelihood of errors and increasing the reliability of the results.
* It can also save time by providing a clear outline of the steps that need to be taken, reducing the need for researchers to come up with a new plan for each experiment.
